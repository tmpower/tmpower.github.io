Hello! I am Eziz from Turkmenistan. I am a software engineer who loves C and likes Python.<br>
I try to write something here, at my blog. Mostly I speak in C.<br>
I do sometimes web development for "living". Some of my projects are:
* [Gulfgroup](http://gulfgroupfze.com/)
* [Berkonum](http://berkonum.com)
* [Stethoscope](https://github.com/tmpower/stethoscope)
* [REST-API](https://github.com/tmpower/experimental-rest-api)


You can find me at social media:
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ezizdurdy)
* [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ezizdurdy)

I do my best (but not enough) to contribute to open source, like Open vSwitch, here at [Github](https://github.com/tmpower).
