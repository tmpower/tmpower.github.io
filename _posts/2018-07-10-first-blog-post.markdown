Here it is.. My first post. I will keep it short.

What am I doing nowadays?:
* Learning Flask framework for my side project
* Refreshing my linear algebra knowledge ( you know the reason :) )
* Compete at some platforms like codeforces, hackerrank to stay sharp
* Learning Golang, just for fun

What am I planning in the near future?:
* Start the 'side project'
* Start learning statistics ( you know the reason :) )
* Learn Rust, just for fun

I am planning to write at least one post a <del>week</del> month. And also sorry for my bad grammar.

Cya!
